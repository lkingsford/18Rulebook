18Rulebook
==========

18Rulebook is a set of templates and tools to quickly generate the basics of
an 18XX rulebook. It exists so new games can choose to do more then include a
list of differences to 1830, and instead provide something that can work by
itself. It also exists so we can collaboratively make common rules more clearly
written.

You can (or will be able) to use it to generate a whole rulebook if the parts
already exist, or at the least be able to get useable sections.

Contributions of code and documentation are very welcome as per our
[Contributor Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

18Rulebook consists of two major parts:

- Templates with which to stick together to make a rulebook

- `18gen` that sticks together templates with variables to make a markdown
  rulebook.
